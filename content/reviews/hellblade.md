__Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice__ is an action-adventure game developed and published by Ninja Theory. It was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in August 2017, and for Xbox One in April 2018. It is focused on Senua's (Melina Juergens) point of view, as she embarks on a very personal journey through a hellish underworld made up of Senua's psychotic manifestations of her reality and mind. Ninja Theory built the game in collaboration with neuroscientists and people who experience psychosis, including consultants from the University of Cambridge, the Wellcome Trust, and Epic Games. The game was inspired by Norse mythology and Celtic culture.

## Gameplay

__Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice__ is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective, viewed from behind the character. The game features a combat system described as "easy to learn, difficult to master" by the developers. The player controls Senua (Melina Juergens), a Pict warrior who must make her way to Helheim by defeating otherworldly entities and facing their challenges, in order to rescue the soul of her dead lover from the goddess Hela. As Senua embarks on her quest, voices in her head give commentary, both about her and on the events unfolding. The game has been compared to a walking simulator game, as the player explores the game world and listens to the voices in Senua's head, which give information about the game world and Senua's past. The game also features puzzles and the occasional boss fight.
